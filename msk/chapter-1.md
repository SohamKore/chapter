#**Chapter 1: They Are Here**

"Wake up, it's snowing, Reon!" Little Betty said excitedly, shaking her big brother's right leg and ruining his cozy morning dream. Reon groaned, curling into himself under the warmth of his bedsheet. Betty yanked the covers off him.

"Father and big brother have already left!"

Reon sat up, grinning at his little sister. "Get my bag and sword. How long has it been since they left?"

"They left before sunrise! You told me that we'd follow them quietly this morning! And yet, here you are, sleeping like a damn troll!" Betty scolded while grabbing his wooden sword and pulling his old, worn-out bag from under his head—where he had been using it as a pillow.

Reon took his bag, brushed his hair back, and walked toward the open window. The cold air from outside blew in, making him shiver slightly. He saw his mother, little brother, and big sister tending to the garden. His little brother, Ron, was gathering small stones from around the house and placing them neatly around the garden. Ron, five years younger than Reon, bore a slight resemblance to him.

Their garden mainly grew vegetables and fruits, but one day, his big sister had planted a small rose bush near the edge. It had been tiny then—smaller than Reon's bag—but now it had grown taller than both his sister and mother. She was trimming the overgrown branches while their mother helped her tie a support stick to the plant.

Maria, their mother, was a woman of striking contrasts. She was both strict and gentle, strong yet graceful. Their father, Edward, often joked that she looked like both an angel and the goddess of death.

"Come on, put on something warm. Let’s go after Father and Ariss!" Betty said excitedly, tugging at Reon's hand.

Reon quickly grabbed his warm fur cloak from the trunk, put it on, and followed Betty toward the door. "Mother shouldn’t know where we’re going. What do we tell her?" Betty asked, glancing back at her brother.

"I'll handle it. Just say 'yes' to whatever I say," Reon instructed, hiding his small wooden sword and bag under his cloak.

"Are pigs flying today? Look who's up early!" Sara, their big sister, teased as they passed her.

Sara was five years older than Reon, who was fourteen. Betty was twelve.

"You don’t have wings, Sara. And you’re too fat to fly anyway," Reon retorted.

Sara had been chubby as a child, though she had since grown into a slender and beautiful young woman. Yet, Reon never let go of his habit of calling her fat whenever she teased him.

"Reon! Not the nicest thing to say to your sister first thing in the morning!" their mother scolded.

"She started it!" Reon grumbled.

Before Maria could respond, Ron interrupted. "Mother, can I go play?"

Maria smiled, gently caressing the soft strands of her youngest child's hair. "Yes, you can go, Ron."

Ron grinned and ran out of the compound gate.

"Uhm, Mother? Betty and I are going to get some firewood from Uncle Axen's. Can we go?" Reon asked.

"The woodshed is already full. Besides, it's too cold today. Come inside. I'm making carrot stew," Maria said.

"Please, Mother! I want to play 'battle-battle' with Timmy. We'll be back before midday," Reon pleaded stubbornly.

Timmy, Uncle Axen's son, was Reon's age. The neighborhood kids often played 'battle-battle,' splitting into two teams and engaging in pretend sword fights. The only rule was to strike below the neck.

Maria sighed. "Alright, but be back early, or you’ll have to eat cold stew."

"We will!" Betty said cheerfully.

Maria pinched her daughter's rosy cheeks affectionately before heading inside, with Sara trailing behind to help in the kitchen.

"Let's go, Betty. Father must be in the forest by now," Reon said as they made their way toward the gate.

### The Incident at Thiriou Forest

Edward, known as Ed to many, was a retired war hero. In his prime, he had been a warrior who fought like ten men, but time had taken its toll. At fifty-five, he struggled with shortness of breath, preventing him from engaging in prolonged battles. However, his strategic mind remained sharp, and his counsel was still highly valued.

The king himself had summoned Ed to investigate a recent, tragic incident near the city outskirts, in the forest of Thiriou. The event had occurred in the dead of night, and only a handful of witnesses had any insight into what had transpired.

One such witness was Aedan, a cattle farmer.

Returning home from the city pub one evening, Aedan had taken his usual path along the dirt trail near the forest. The peaceful night was shattered by a blood-curdling scream. Initially dismissing it as a trick of his imagination, he froze when he heard a desperate woman's voice crying out, "Anyone... please help!"

Rushing toward the sound, he saw a horrifying sight—a gaunt, humanoid figure crawling on all fours, retreating hastily into the forest. It carried something near what appeared to be its mouth.

Aedan reached the house, pounding on the door. "Don? Elena? Are you alright?"

The door creaked open, revealing Elena, her clothes soaked in blood. A deep claw mark ran from her cheek down to her neck. Behind her, Don lay lifeless, his body torn apart by vicious claw marks.

"It took my son..." Elena sobbed.

Aedan’s stomach churned. Her son, Jesu, was only two years old. He suddenly realized what the creature had been carrying.

Despite summoning a medic, Don was already dead. Elena had lost both her husband and son in a single night. The villagers were torn between disbelief and horror as Elena described the monster that had stolen her child.

"It was pale, with rotting flesh, its ribs exposed. Its jaw hung crooked, lined with razor-sharp teeth. Its eyes glowed pale like the moon. Its long, clawed hands reached past its knees."

Many dismissed it as wild monkeys, unwilling to accept something far worse might be lurking in the dark.

Even Ed, upon hearing the account, was skeptical. Yet, something about Elena’s terror-stricken eyes convinced him that she had encountered something truly evil that night.

The king was deeply concerned. Panic was spreading in the trade city—a bustling marketplace where merchants and travelers gathered. If the fear continued, it could impact commerce and prosperity. He needed answers. And so, Ed prepared to leave for Thiriou.

#Highsky Mansion – Morning of the Investigation
"Ariss, wake up. We’re leaving," Ed whispered to his son, careful not to wake the others.

At the sound of his father’s voice, Ariss was already getting out of bed. "Yes, Father! I'll grab my satchel," he said modestly, moving toward the small wooden table beside his bed.

"I’ve got your bag. Grab your cloak and sword, then meet me downstairs," Ed instructed, walking out of Ariss’s room.

Ariss deeply admired his father. More than admiration, he respected him. He had grown up listening to stories of Edward Highsky’s bravery in war. There wasn’t a man who could compare to him—a master battle strategist and a fearless swordsman. Noblemen and scholars often spoke of his father’s contributions to the Great Kingdom War, a conflict that involved every kingdom and left behind famine and countless casualties, both commoners and noblemen alike.

The veterans of war often recited a poem written by a boy who had lost everything—his family to famine, his father to war, and his future to the selfish ambitions of noblemen who claimed divine will as their justification. In the end, he too became a casualty of war. That boy had written:

Take me to my mother; I'll die a happy man in her arms.
I do not seek the honor of a war hero; I do not see myself among those stars.

Many wars we have fought, many lives we have taken,
In the name of a god who remains unspoken.

If the greatest honor is to die a martyr, fighting for our motherland,
Then grant that castle king his honor too—
Find a golden sword for his hand.

I see a brother in my enemy,
A preying beast in my own lord.
For the enemy frees me from my misery,
While my lord hands me a bloody sword.

I do not fear death nor the act of killing,
But I fear dying like this, leaving my gratitude to my mother unfulfilled.

Take me to my mother; let her know I am grateful.
I'll die a happy man in her arms, forever faithful.

A war had immortalized a poem, and a poem had immortalized a boy—just fifteen years old, the same age Edward had been during that war. Edward had known the boy personally, had fought beside him, and had seen him die—not in battle, but afterward, from his wounds, his broken hand, and his shattered heart. Lying on the cold ground, the boy had begged a passing scholar to write a letter for him. That letter was later read before the late king by the rebels. It became a symbol of sacrifice and bravery among warriors.

Ariss made his way down the wooden stairs to the hall, where his mother was fastening his father’s fur cloak before handing him his sword.
